# The Bannon Framework: Governance for the Agentic Future

This document summarizes governance principles that inform the Agent Governance Scorecard, based on the published research and public statements of **Tracy Bannon**, Senior Principal Software Architect at MITRE Corporation.

## Tracy Bannon's Vision of the Agentic Future

Tracy "Trac" Bannon leads MITRE's ArchAITecture initiative and research
collaborations (A²RC) focused on integrating AI into the software development
lifecycle. She envisions a future where AI systems evolve from tools to
teammates — active participants in software engineering.

> "Generative AI is not just changing how we build software — it's changing
> what software is."

---

## From Tools to Teammates

Bannon believes we are pivoting from using AI as a passive helper toward
treating AI as active team members:

> "We must move beyond viewing AI as 'merely a tool' and start envisioning
> a future filled with AI agents as team members."

This means AI agents take on autonomous roles in coding, testing, and other
tasks — becoming co-developers alongside humans. The goal is an AI-augmented
software team that delivers quality software faster by combining:

- **AI strengths**: Speed, pattern-recognition, tireless execution
- **Human strengths**: Intuition, contextual understanding, judgment

## Agentic Digital Platforms

Bannon's vision extends beyond individual AI assistants to **agentic digital
platforms** — entire software ecosystems that can create, manage, and maintain
software with minimal human intervention.

She describes a "complete software flywheel":

> "I build the digital platform (using whatever help I need). The digital
> platform creates, manages, maintains software."

The development environment itself becomes autonomous and self-sustaining —
continuously generating applications and features within governed boundaries.

### The Future Is Already Here

Bannon notes this isn't theoretical:

> "The agentic future isn't coming — it's already here."

Evidence includes:
- Organizations running hundreds/thousands of AI agents in production
- 60+ million AI agent executions per month across 150+ countries
- 80-90% efficiency improvements in key processes
- Complex products (hundreds of Lambda functions) generated by governed agents

## The Governance Imperative

Crucially, Bannon emphasizes that realizing the agentic future requires
**strong governance and architectural discipline**:

> "AI should be treated not as magic, but as software and data — meaning it
> must be governed by proper software architecture and engineering practices,
> not guesswork."

### Control Towers

Organizations must establish centralized AI agent management:

> "Organizations must establish 'control towers' for AI — treating agents as
> organizational resources that need management and accountability, rather
> than as uncontrolled experiments."

### The Three Pillars

To manage fleets of AI agents at scale, Bannon identifies three critical
governance factors:

| Pillar | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Interoperability** | Avoid vendor lock-in; ensure agents work across platforms |
| **Observability** | Complete visibility into agent actions and decisions |
| **Governance** | Strict controls over data access and permissions |

### Traceability Over Blind Trust

A consistent theme in Bannon's vision:

> "Traceability over blind trust should guide any AI agent's actions."

This means:
- Guardrails for security, ethics, compliance
- Rigorous testing and validation of AI outputs
- Mechanisms for human review of agent-generated work
- Audit trails for all agent decisions

## Human-in-the-Loop: Calibrated Trust

A cornerstone of the agentic future is that human engineers remain deeply
involved — not writing every line of code, but providing guidance, oversight,
and creative direction.

### The Partnership Model

- Humans set objectives and constraints
- AI agents generate solutions
- Humans review and refine
- AI executes within boundaries

### Calibrated Trust

Bannon calls for "calibrated trust" within teams:

> "We don't just need people who use AI. We need people who design for AI
> and with AI."

This means developers learn:
- When to trust AI output
- When to double-check or intervene
- How to design systems that leverage AI safely

### Verification and Ownership

Even as agents take on more tasks:

> "Humans must retain ultimate verification and ownership of the software."

This requires:
- Checkpoints for human review
- Automated tests and validation pipelines
- CI/CD for AI (catching agent errors)
- Final human sign-off on critical decisions

---

## The Infrastructure Gap

Bannon and her peers recognize that realizing this future requires new
infrastructure:

> "Realizing this future at scale will require more than just sophisticated
> AI models; it demands new infrastructure, frameworks, and cultural shifts."

They are building "infrastructure for the agentic future":
- Reference architectures
- Governance models
- Training programs
- Evaluation frameworks

**This scorecard is part of that infrastructure.**

---

## Who Wins in the Agentic Future?

Bannon's view on competitive advantage:

> "The 'winners' in this new era will not necessarily be those with the
> fanciest AI models, but those who master the orchestration of AI agents —
> integrating them into their value stream effectively and safely."

Success factors:
- Tying AI efforts to real ROI and business value
- Effective orchestration, not just powerful models
- Governed operations that scale
- Human-AI collaboration that works

---

## Summary

Tracy Bannon's agentic future is:

- **AI agents as teammates**, not just tools
- **Agentic platforms** that build and maintain software
- **Governed operations** with control towers and audit trails
- **Calibrated trust** with humans in the loop
- **Infrastructure** that enables safe scaling

The Agent Governance Scorecard translates these principles into evaluable
criteria — providing objective measures of whether a platform is ready for
the agentic future Bannon describes.
